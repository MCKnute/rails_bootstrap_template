This is a very basic Ruby on Rails template, utilizing PostgreSQL for the database and Bootstrap with SASS for the front end. 

Also includes one controller called Welcome.

Note that /app/assets/stylesheets/welcome.scss contains the body padding for the Jumbotron; all controllers using the Jumbotron should have that body padding code.
